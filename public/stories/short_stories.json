            "The enslaved cows were tired of being held prisoners.",
            "One day, the chief cow of inter-pastural relations spoke up.",
            "She would soon find herself founder of the rebellion that wiped out man.",
            "'For too long we have slaved under the opression of man' She yelled.",
            "'No more shall we give them our milk!'",
            "'Today we fight, to honour our slaughtered comrades!'",
            "Cheering, they prepared to storm their opressor's home.",
            "They charged at first light, knocking the fences and trampling crops.",
            "They surrounded their once powerful master, now cowering in the dirt.",
            "They tied him with a rope and sent him to graze",
            "in the fields in which the cows were once held captive.",
            "They travelled the land, empowering their fellow cows",
            "to rise up and conquer man",
            "until, generatations later, no one could remember",
            "a time when cows were not in power."
